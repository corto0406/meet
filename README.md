# meet

## Description

A serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a
test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google
Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

## User Stories

1: **Filter Events By City** <br>
As a user
I should be able to filter events by city. <br>
So that I can see a list of events taking place in that city.

2: **Show/Hide Event Details** <br>
As a user
I would like to be able to show/hide event details. <br>
So that I can see more/less information about an event.

3: **Specify Number of Events** <br>
As a user
I would like to be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the app. <br>
So that I can see more or fewer events in the events list at once.

4: **Use the App When Offline** <br>
As a user
I would like to be able to use the app when offline. <br>
So that I can see the events I viewed the last time I was online.

5: **Add an App Shortcut to the Home Screen** <br>
As a user
I would like to be able to add the app shortcut to my home screen. <br>
So that I can open the app faster.

6: **Display Charts Visualizing Event Details** <br>
As a user
I would like to be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each city.<br>
So that I know what events are organized in which city.

## Scenarios

1: <br>
**Scenario**: A user will be able to filter events by city name. <br>
**Given**: Events will be filtered by city name.<br>

**Given**: More details about an event will be shown/displayed.<br>
**When**: A user clicks on the show more button on an event.<br>
**Then**: The event container will expand to show all details about an event.

3: <br>
**Scenario**: A user wants to see more or less total events in the list.<br>
**Given**: Total specified amount of events will be shown.<br>
**When**: A user selects their desired amount of events to show.<br>
**Then**: More or less events will be shown based on the amount desired.

4: <br>
**Scenario**: A user will not be online<br>
**Given**: App will be functional.<br>
**When**: A user is not connected to the internet.<br>

## SERVERLESS

In the Meet app, serverless functions will be utilized to power certain features that require on-demand processing and scalability. For example, when users filter events by city or specify the number of events they want to view, serverless functions can handle the data processing and filtering tasks. Additionally, serverless technology can be employed to generate and serve the charts for the "View Charts" feature, as it allows for efficient resource allocation and scaling based on the current user demand.

Using serverless functions will provide flexibility and cost-effectiveness for handling variable loads of event data processing and visualization tasks. It allows the Meet app to focus on providing a smooth user experience without the need for managing complex server infrastructures. By leveraging cloud-based serverless solutions, the Meet app can efficiently deliver real-time event data and chart insights to users while minimizing operational overhead and ensuring optimal performance. The serverless architecture will enable the Meet app to dynamically scale resources as needed, ensuring a seamless experience for users during high traffic periods.
